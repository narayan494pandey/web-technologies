                        To work out what your current Laptop screen size is, measure from the bottom left-hand corner to
                        the
                        top right-hand corner in a straight line. Following these numbers is the model year label.
                        This can be one or two letters followed by a number. In our example, KS means the TV is a 2016
                        Ultra
                        High Definition model.
